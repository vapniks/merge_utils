| colwise2              | Like 'colwise', but the returned function will return unaffected columns alongside affected ones if possible. |
| complete.cases2       | Find complete cases/rows of data.frame with respect to a set of variables.                                    |
| contents              | Find contents of variables/factors - either "numeric", "logical" or "character"                               |
| dupsBetweenDFs        | Find rows that are duplicated across dataframes                                                               |
| dupsBetweenGroups     | Find rows of dataframe that are duplicated between groups (indicated by a grouping variable).                 |
| is.character.contents | Test if contents of vector are character/string values.                                                       |
| is.logical.contents   | Test if contents of vector are logical (TRUE/FALSE) values.                                                   |
| is.numeric.contents   | Test if contents of vector are numeric values.                                                                |
| matchByDistance       | Match elements of one set with closest elements of another set, according to their mutual distances.          |
| matchStrings          | Match strings in A with strings in B                                                                          |
| merge_utils-package   | Functions to aid merging disparate datasets                                                                   |
| multimerge            | Merge multiple dataframe by common columns.                                                                   |
| recodeAs              | Recode unique values of one variable to match unique values of another variable.                              |
| recodeDF              | Recode collection of variables so that they all have the same unique values.                                  |
| recodeDFas            | Recode variables in dataframe to match codes in another dataframe                                             |
| recodeMatches         | Recode values of variable/factor matching patterns                                                            |
| recodeReverse         | Recode an ordered variable by reversing the codes.                                                            |

| uniqueNotNA           | Like 'unique' but omits NA's or NaN's, suppresses warnings, and returns result as character vector.           |
| numUnique             | Return the number of unique elements of x (excluding NA & NaN's)                                              |
